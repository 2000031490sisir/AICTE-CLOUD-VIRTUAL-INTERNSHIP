This is my in-depth experience about how i completed my AICTE cloud virtual internship successfully in time and the knowledge i gained through out the  internship period.

The program is divided into the following six learning modules:
1.	Student Guides: You can study all the related information related to each service offered by AWS in details in addition to the underlying use and purpose of that service in Cloud World. You can look at the screenshots and visual representations of functionalities and basic features of each cloud service offered by Amazon web Services.
2.	Section Videos: You can watch and learn through the videos by AWS experts and get the idea of Cloud computing services and benefits in a shorter period of time.
3.	Knowledge Checks:  You can check your knowledge with set of multiple choice questions which include single and multi correct questions and we have to pass the quizzes with required pass percentage.
4.	Guided Labs: We must complete the guided labs with temporary access to the required AWS resources and detailed set of instructions are provided.
5.	Challenge Labs: We have to complete the challenges given with limited number of instructions and temporary access to required AWS resources.
6.	Capstone Project: We have to complete a project in a limited duration and complete a set of tasks with temporary access to required AWS resources.

In my view, AICTE has provided with perfect learning experience i ever needed. I have always wanted to get into the cloud world and understand the main purpose behind this immense demand on cloud across the world. With this internship, I am glad to acquire knowledge about almost every important area of Amazon Web Services.
